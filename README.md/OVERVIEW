# Materials-Property-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning techniques to predict 
key material properties such as yield strength, fatigue life, and ductility based 
on compositional and processing parameters. It utilizes datasets from 
Materials Project, OQMD, and Citrine and employs models like Random Forest, XGBoost, 
and Neural Networks (GNNs/CNNs) for accurate predictions.
